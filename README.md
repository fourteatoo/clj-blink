# clj-blink

A Clojure library to use the Blink Camera REST API.  The protocol is
not officially disclosed but has been reverse engineered by Matt
Weinecke.  See https://github.com/MattTW/BlinkMonitorProtocol

## Usage

Require the library in your source code

```clojure
(require '[fourteatoo.clj-blink.api :as blink])
```

The first time you use the library you need to register your client
and obtain an access token

```clojure
(def client (blink/register-client "username" "password"))
```

This will trigger whatever you have configured for 2FA.  A PIN will be
sent by Blink to your designated authentication means: an email, an
SMS, whatever.  Type it in.

Any subsequent authentications should instead do:

```clojure
(def client (blink/authenticate-client "username" "password" "unique-id"))
```

The `username` and `password` are the same as those used for the
`register-client`.  The `unique-id` is the same one returned (and
displayed) by `register-client`.

The authentication is valid for 24 hours but its automatically renewed
by the libary.

You can use your client parameters like this:

```clojure
(blink/get-networks client)
```

then you can, for instance, arm all your systems (assuming you have
more than one):

```clojure
(->> (get-networks client)
     :networks
     (run! #(system-arm client (:id %))))
```

or disarm them, substituting `system-arm` for `system-disarm`.

Have a look at https://github.com/MattTW/BlinkMonitorProtocol and the
source code.
